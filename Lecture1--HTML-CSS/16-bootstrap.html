<!-- Bootstrap is a CSS library written to help make clean, responsive, and nice-looking websites without
     having to remember the gritty details about flexboxes or grids everytime a layout needs to be set up. -->

<!-- The only thing needed to use Bootstrap is by adding a single line which links Bootstrapâ€™s CSS stylesheet:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
     integrity="sha384-WskhaSGFgHYWDcbwN70/dfYBj47jz9qbsMId/iRN3ewGhXQFZCSftd1LZCfmhktB" crossorigin="anonymous">
