# To start a flask application, just run "python application.py" like you would to run any other python scripts.
# But unlike your typical Python script, this script, thanks to the Flask library, will start a local webserver.
# with the following message in the terminal,
#   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

# Now your computer is serving (hosting) the flask application on this particular URL
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/
# (127.0.0.1 always refers to your own machine)

# Whenever someone (a web browser) visits the homepage, the following message is the response by your web server,
# 127.0.0.1 - - [14/Jul/2020 01:06:56] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -

# Whenever someone (a web browser) tries to visits a web page that doesn't exist,
# 127.0.0.1 - - [14/Jul/2020 01:09:08] "GET /wtf HTTP/1.1" 404 -

# This web app will run forever until you shut down your computer or use "ctrl + c" to shut down the web server

# (but that's kind of beyond the scope for now)

# The my_app object's route method defines what URL the application should respond to
# And when the specified URL is visited by a browser, the view function will execute and display content to the user.
# (It doesn't matter what we name the view functions)

# If youâ€™re on the Anaconda distribution, you should already have flask installed.

# To start up a flask application in the terminal, run "flask run" in the directory
# where application.py is located, with flask being the web server. Flask will print
# out the URL the server is running on, which is where the website can be accessed at.

# Run "export FLASK_ENV=development" to turn on debug mode

# If "flask run" produces an error, try running "export FLASK_APP=application.py" to make sure it
# knows to look for application.py as the web server.
