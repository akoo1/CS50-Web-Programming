# If youâ€™re on the Anaconda distribution, you should already have flask installed.

# To start up a flask application, run "flask run" in the directory where application.py is located,
# with flask being the web server. Flask will print out the URL the server is running on and where
# the website can be accessed at. If "flask run" produces an error, try running "export FLASK_APP=application.py"
# to make sure it knows to look for application.py as the web server.

# Run "export FLASK_ENV=development" to turn on debug mode
# After running "flask run", your computer is serving the flask application, and it's runnign it on this paticular
# URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/
