# Sessions are how Flask can keep track of data that belongs to a particular user.
# Letâ€™s take a note-taking app, for example. Users should only be able to see their own notes.

# Gives access to a variable called "session" which is used to keep values for a particular user
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, session

# notes = []     This global notes variable is no longer neeed

# session is a dictionary that belongs to only one user.
# Every user has a unique session dict, and therefore a unique notes list.
# The advantage here is that this server can have multiple different session going on, so each user is
# independent to each other, we don't have one global notes variable shared among all users.
